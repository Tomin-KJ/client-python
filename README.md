## HAPI client for Python

Attempts to match syntax/capabilities/interface of the [HAPI MATLAB client](https://github.com/hapi-server/matlab-client).

Reads HAPI CSV and binary.

Requires Python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) that are typically shipped with a Scientific Python distribution, e.g., [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/).  Tested using the Spyder GUI that ships with Anaconda for Python 3.6.

To test, execute `hapi_demo.py`.
