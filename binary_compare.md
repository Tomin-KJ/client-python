Typical results for speed difference between "binary" and "sensiblebinary":

```
fbin w/ints total: 0.0020s
fbin total:        0.0017s
bin memmap:        0.0003s
bin extract time:  0.4519s
bin extract data:  0.0000s
bin total:         0.4522s

bin/fbin         : 273.7278
bin/(fbin w/ints): 228.0462
```
